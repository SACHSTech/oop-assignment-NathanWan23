## Summary
*Include a brief summary that describes your system that your are modelling*

My model is a fast food burger resturant. It is a system where the user looks through the menu then orders and after they are done ordering, they can proceed to checkout. The program will first pop open a menu where the user can select what item they want to view and if they want to add it to the order. If the user inputs that they want to order this item, they will be asked what they want whether it be size or if they want their chicken burger to be crispy or not. After they have inputed all the speficiations for that item, it will be added to the order with a specific name. When they are finished ordering, the user can proceed to checkout where they can see all the items they have added, their names, price then at the bottom the sub-total, tax, and total.
